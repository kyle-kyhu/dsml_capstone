Capstone Proposal
Domain Background
The Titanic disaster is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. This project aims to analyze the factors that influenced the survival of passengers using machine learning techniques.

Problem Statement
The goal is to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on various features such as age, sex, passenger class, and other socio-economic factors.

Datasets and Inputs
Training Data: train.csv
Test Data: test.csv
Submission Data: titanic_submission.csv
Solution Statement
We will preprocess the data, engineer relevant features, and apply machine learning models to predict passenger survival. The primary model used will be a Random Forest Classifier.

Benchmark Model
The benchmark model will be a Random Forest Classifier, which has shown an accuracy of 0.8156 on the validation set.

Evaluation Metrics
Confusion Matrix: To visualize the performance of the classification model.
Accuracy: 0.8045
Precision: 0.7910
Recall: 0.7162
F1 Score: 0.7518

Project Design
Defining the Problem Statement: Analyze the factors influencing survival.
Collecting the Data: Use the provided Titanic dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualize and understand the data.
Feature Engineering: Handle missing values, convert categorical variables, and scale features.
Modeling: Train a Random Forest Classifier.
Testing: Evaluate the model using the test dataset and generate a submission file.
